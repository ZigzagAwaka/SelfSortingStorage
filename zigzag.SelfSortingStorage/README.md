# Self Sorting Storage

Adds a new unlockable ship ugrade to the game : the Smart Cupboard!

This storage container who looks a lot like the vanilla Cupboard furniture, has the effect to automatically sorts equipment items that you store in.

Compatible with v69 of Lethal Company.

##

### Smart Cupboard
On the side of this special Cupboard, you can find a storage box where players can dump their tools like flashlights, walkie-talkies, shovels, spray paints and more.

The storage will then sort these tools and put them on display in specific sections. Then all items will be organized and ready for players to grab and go!

### More info
- If you dump multiples copies of the same item, the storage will have them all stacked on top of each other. BUT

- Configurable time for the routing animation, other than the default values
- A config to make moons only be chosen once, will reset if every moons have been visited (false by default)
- Configurable moons blacklist to prevent specific moons to be chosen randomly
- Synchronize the chosen moon info on the ship's monitor
- Removes the 'Halt!' warning on the last day when auto routing to the Company Building
- Prevent the random selection of Gordion before the last day of the quota
- Prevent the random selection of Liquidation since the moon is disabled in vanilla (fixed a softlock)
- A config to have all moons free even if you disable random moons
- Updated to the latest version of the game and compatible with LLL to avoid any desync between players
